Project Title: Temperature Based Automatic Watering of Crops 

Description: 
The prototype we will build has a temperature and water control. Esp8266 Node MCU, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor are the materials that we'll be working with. These materials can be used to create a prototype for a device that can determine whether crops or plants need watering or are still healthy. If the DHT11 sensor detects a high temperature, the crops will quickly dry out and require water to be alive. To monitor if the crops and plants are still healthy, the temperature data and water level will be published online. This device will be useful to the adapted community of Mapua University because this will notify them to water their crops. No crops will dry out when this device is applied to the community. 

Objectives: 
1. Measure air temperature and humidity, and soil moisture. 
2. Activate watering based on air and soil conditions.  
3. Notify the user of crop watering conditions. 
4. Publish the temperature and soil moisture data online. 

Test Cases: 
1. Servo Motor will rotate if temperature is 30.50 degrees Celsius and above.  
2. Servo Motor will remain its rotation state if the temperature is 30.50 degrees Celsius and above. 
3. Servo Motor will not rotate if temperature is 30.40 degrees Celsius and below. 
4. Servo Motor will remain stimulant if the temperature is 30.40 degrees Celsius and below.
